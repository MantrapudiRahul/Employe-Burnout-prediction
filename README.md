Employee burnout prediction is an increasingly important area of research and application in human resources and organizational management. Burnout, characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment, can lead to decreased productivity, increased absenteeism, and higher turnover rates. Predicting burnout can help organizations take proactive measures to prevent it and support employee well-being.
